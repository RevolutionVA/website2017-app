                    <h2 class="league-gothic">The Quick Version</h2>
                    <p>RevolutionConf is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone,
                        regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability,
                        physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology
                        choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language
                        and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties,
                        Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned
                        or expelled from the conference <em>without a refund</em> at the discretion of the conference
                        organizers.</p>
                    <h2 class="league-gothic">The Less Quick Version</h2>
                    <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression,
                        age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion,
                        technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
                        following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
                        inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
                    <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
                    <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use
                        sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not
                        use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>
                    <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action
                        they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no
                        refund.</p>
                    <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
                        concerns, please contact a member of the staff immediately. RevolutionConf staff can be
                        identified as they’ll be wearing red t-shirts.</p>
                    <p>RevolutionConf staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law
                        enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for
                        the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>
                    <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at RevolutionConf venues and conference-related
                        social events.</p>
